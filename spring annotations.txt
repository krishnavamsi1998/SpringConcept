@autowired - inject the dependency

@Component - is an annotation that allows Spring to automatically detect our custom beans , basically decalring a bean 

@Configuration - indicates that this class is like a configuration class which helps to find out the beans that are need to be created

@ComponentScan - searches the specified package for classes which are annotated with @Component

@Bean- is a method level annotation and name of the method serves as the bean name

ex:
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public TransferService transferService() {
        return new TransferServiceImpl();
    }
}

so spring frames it as:

<beans>
    <bean name="transferService" class="com.acme.TransferServiceImpl"/>
</beans>


@bean 				@component
1.Method level 			1.class level
2.work only when a class is also	2.works without @configuration 
annotated with @configuration

-spring data jpa annotations 

@Entity : it is specified above the class and creates a table in database
@Table(name="tableName") : to alter the table name or to put some constriants like unique columns etc
@Id : refers to primary key
@Column(name="columnName") : to specify custom column name or to put some constraints 

@SequenceGenerator : to auto increment a particular column such as studentID etc 

@GeneratedValue : post specifying @SequenceGenerator


@Repository : to mark the interface as repository


@Builder :

we want to use a builder to create instances of our class.

The first and only step is to add the annotation to the class declaration:

@Getter
@Builder
public class Widget {
    private final String name;
    private final int id;
}

Widget testWidget = Widget.builder()
  .name("foo")
  .id(1)
  .build();

assertThat(testWidget.getName())
  .isEqualTo("foo");
assertThat(testWidget.getId())
  .isEqualTo(1);

@Query : pass JPQL query above the custom method

@Query(value="sql query" , nativeQuery=true)

The @Modifying annotation is used to enhance the @Query annotation so that we can execute not only SELECT queries, but also INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and even DDL queries.

 Result of NOT Using the @Modifying Annotation

@Query("delete User u where u.active = false")
int deleteDeactivatedUsersWithNoModifyingAnnotation();
Notice the missing annotation.

When we execute the above method, we get an InvalidDataAccessApiUsage exception:

org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: org.hibernate.hql.internal.QueryExecutionRequestException: 
Not supported for DML operations [delete com.baeldung.boot.domain.User u where u.active = false]
(...)

On whichever method you declare @Transactional the boundary of transaction starts and boundary ends when method completes.

Entity relationships often depend on the existence of another entity, for example the Person–Address relationship. Without the Person, the Address entity doesn't have any meaning of its own. When we delete the Person entity, our Address entity should also get deleted.

Cascading is the way to achieve this. When we perform some action on the target entity, the same action will be applied to the associated entity.

ex:

ALL
PERSIST
MERGE
REMOVE
REFRESH
DETACH

FETCH TYPE=LAZY : fetch only specific class

FETCH TYPE=EAGER : fetch all the relationship classes associated with the 
specified class

Spring Boot

@SpringBootApplication 

Many Spring Boot developers like their apps to use auto-configuration, component scan and be able to define extra configuration on their "application class". A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:

@EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism
@ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
@Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes
 
example :

package com.example.myapplication;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication // same as @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

}

@Controller

The @Controller annotation indicates that a particular class serves the role of a controller. Spring does not require you to extend any controller base class or reference the Servlet API.

@RestController= @Controller + @ResponseBody

Spring 4.0 introduced the @RestController annotation in order to simplify the creation of RESTful web services. It's a convenient annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, which eliminates the need to annotate every request handling method of the controller class with the @ResponseBody annotation.

@RequestMapping- used to map web requests onto specific handler classes and/or handler methods

similarily we have

@GetMapping
@PostMapping
@DeleteMapping etc
 
@RequestBody annotation is applicable to handler methods of Spring controllers. This annotation indicates that Spring should deserialize a request body into an object. This object is passed as a handler method parameter.

@PathVariable annotation can be used to handle template variables in the request URI mapping, and set them as method parameters.

It is enclosed with {flowerBracket}

ex :
@GetMapping("/api/employeeswithvariable/{id}")

Multiple Path Variables

@GetMapping("/api/employees/{id}/{name}")
@ResponseBody
public String getEmployeesByIdAndName(@PathVariable String id, @PathVariable String name) {
    return "ID: " + id + ", name: " + name;
}

@NotNull

CharSequence, Collection, Map or Array object cannot be null, however can be empty.

@NotEmpty

The CharSequence, Collection, Map or Array object cannot be null and not empty (size > 0).

@NotBlank

The string is not null and the length is greater than zero.

Here are the examples:

String test = null;
@NotNull: false
@NotEmpty: false
@NotBlank: false

String test = "";
@NotNull: true
@NotEmpty: false
@NotBlank: false

String test = " ";
@NotNull: true
@NotEmpty: true
@NotBlank: false

String name = "Some text";
@NotNull: true
@NotEmpty: true
@NotBlank: true

The spring framework provides five scopes for a bean. We can use three of them only in the context of web-aware Spring ApplicationContext and the rest of the two is available for both IoC container and Spring-MVC container. The following are the different scopes provided for a bean: 
 

Singleton: Only one instance will be created for a single bean definition per Spring IoC container and the same object will be shared for each request made for that bean.

Prototype: A new instance will be created for a single bean definition every time a request is made for that bean.

Request: A new instance will be created for a single bean definition every time an HTTP request is made for that bean. But Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

Session: Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of an HTTP Session. But Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

Global-Session: Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a global HTTP Session. It is also only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

Spring Boot built-in starters make development easier and rapid. Spring Boot Starters are the dependency descriptors.

In the Spring Boot Framework, all the starters follow a similar naming pattern: spring-boot-starter-*, where * denotes a particular type of application.

For example, if we want to use Spring and JPA for database access, we need to include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in our pom.xml file of the project.

some examples :

spring-boot-starter-web

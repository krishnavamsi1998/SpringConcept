What is the in-memory database

In-memory database relies on system memory as oppose to disk space for storage of data. Because memory access is faster than disk access. We use the in-memory database when we do not need to persist the data. The in-memory database is an embedded database. The in-memory databases are volatile, by default, and all stored data loss when we restart the application.

The widely used in-memory databases are H2, HSQLDB (HyperSQL Database), and Apache Derby. It creates the configuration automatically.

Persistence vs. In-memory Database
The persistent database persists the data in physical memory. The data will be available even if the database server is bounced. Some popular persistence databases are Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, etc.

In the case of the in-memory database, data store in the system memory. It lost the data when the program is closed. It is helpful for POCs (Proof of Concepts), not for a production application. The widely used in-memory database is H2.


What is the H2 Database
H2 is an embedded, open-source, and in-memory database. It is a relational database management system written in Java. It is a client/server application. It is generally used in unit testing. It stores data in memory, not persist the data on disk.

Advantages

Zero configuration
It is easy to use.
It is lightweight and fast.
It provides simple Configuration to switch between a real database and in-memory database.
It supports standard SQL and JDBC API.
It provides a web console to maintain in the database.

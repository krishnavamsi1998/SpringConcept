Maven is a powerful project management tool or build tool 

There are many problems that we face during the project development. They are discussed below:

1) Adding set of Jars in each project: In case of struts, spring, hibernate frameworks, we need to add set of jar files in each project. It must include all the dependencies of jars also.

2) Creating the right project structure: We must create the right project structure in servlet, struts etc, otherwise it will not be executed.

3) Building and Deploying the project: We must have to build and deploy the project so that it may work.

Maven simplifies the above mentioned problems. It does mainly following tasks.

It makes a project easy to build
It provides uniform build process (maven project can be shared by all the maven projects)
It provides project information (log document, cross referenced sources, mailing list, dependency list, unit test reports etc.)
It is easy to migrate for new features of Maven

A build tool takes care of everything for building a process. It does following:

Generates source code (if auto-generated code is used)
Generates documentation from source code
Compiles source code
Packages compiled code into JAR of ZIP file
Installs the packaged code in local repository, server repository, or central repository

Different kinds of Spring Data repository interfaces:

CrudRepository

Each of these defines its own functionality:

CrudRepository provides CRUD functions

PagingAndSortingRepository provides methods to do pagination and sort records

JpaRepository provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch
